          <p>You sure have done your research, eh? Awesome!</p>
          <p>Yes! Such courses are available even for dirt-cheap prices. No denying that!</p>
          <p>But we are charging a premium price for 3 reasons:</p>
          <p>Prepare for interviews</p>
          <p>Create an online profile that attracts recruiters from top IT companies</p>
          <p>Teach soft skills</p>
          <p>Talks by real-time professionals</p>
          <p>Daily challenges</p>
          <p>Use on-trend tools that are currently recommended in the IT industry. (Other courses, don’t teach you the tools)</p>
          <p>And a lot more!</p>
          <p>All these take humongous effort for our team.</p>
          <p>We will not leave you like an orphan once the course is over. We’re PROMISING YOU A JOB that pays anywhere between 3.5-6 lakh per annum.</p>
          <p>No other training program promises you even a JOB. Let alone a well-paying one!</p>
          <p>We are offering you 100% Guarantee.</p>
          <p>No other training program does that in India.</p>
          <p>We’re investing in your success. Only if you succeed, our efforts will be rewarded. If you don’t get a well-paying IT job as we promised, the financial loss is only for us.</p>
          <p>So we are demanding the price to ensure you get the best course modules, quality instructors, and results.</p>
          <p>Our training happens in real-time. That means, you will get to interact and learn from your mentors exactly as you do in your classrooms.</p>
          <p>With the process, team and connects we have, we are confident about your placement and we want you to do your best.</p>
          <p>Consider all these facts, and you will know this would be the best investment for your career</p>

        <p>That’s why we are focusing on Full Stack Developer, which is a reliable way to land a lucrative IT job in top companies.</p>
        <p>Anyway, if you are seeking to learn new technologies, we are not for you. We’re interested in only enrolling people who want to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>

          <p>However, take our program only if you are serious about becoming a well-paid full stack developer in top software companies.  Else, be happy with whatever you are doing. God bless!</p>

          <p>We are pretty much sure and confident about placement because of the process we follow. If you as candidates are regular to classes, uptodate with assignments and projects, and have cleared mocks then you will definitely get placed.</p>
          <p>Besides, you can check our previous batches students refer how things went for them and make a decision. We are sure you wont regret it.</p>
          <p>And we already have a track record of placing more than 350+ students in the last 3 years.</p>

          <p>Unless, you pay money from your (or, maybe dad’s or mom’s!) pocket and make a financial commitment, we cannot expect that you will be dedicated to the training.</p>
          <p>You might show up for a few days. Disappear. Come back. Disappear.</p>
          <p>So nope! That’s not going to work for us.</p>

          <p>
            As an entrepreneur who’s constantly finding ways to help people
            reach greater heights in their career and an Ex-Oracle guy, I know
            EXACTLY what it takes to launch a career in the IT industry. The
            truth is your background or your degrees don’t matter! What matters
            is your skills, only your skills!

          <p>
            A pioneer in Learning & Development, Praveen always felt disengaged
            with traditional education. He believes supplementing education with
            relevant and engaging experience would prepare students for careers
            in the tech industry. He currently leads the program design at 10000
            coders and brings in all his experience in studying various programs
            in the west to India for your success.
